# Tensorflow networks in C++

This repository provides instrumentary for inferencing tensorflow networks using Tensorflow bingdings for C++ 
and performing image retrieval with them.

### Requirements

* Tensorflow
* Protobuf
* Opencv (may be remove it later)
* Abseil _(for tests)_

#### Instructions

* Easy way to install tensorflow is by using [this](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/tensorflow-cpp) repository. 
It's uses prebuild binaries so it also very fast to install.

* For Protobuf installing I suggest using [this](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md) instructions.
_The version that I'm using is 3.7.0_

* Abseil have classic way to install from [here](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp)
